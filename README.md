# Forecasting Store Sales for Walmart
This was a recruitment competition conducted by Walmart in 2014, which I have selected as my capstone project submission for the [Springboard - Foundations to Data Science Course](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science).

Please refer to the [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting) for the full details of the problem and dataset.
